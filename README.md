## Setup

1. Add the workflow file to your repository:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p .github/workflows
   cp release-notes.yml .github/workflows/
   ```

2. Configure required secrets in your GitHub repository:
   - `CONFLUENCE_API_TOKEN`: Your Confluence API token
   - `JIRA_API_TOKEN`: (Optional) If you want to fetch JIRA ticket details

3. Update the following environment variables in the workflow file:
   ```yaml

   CONFLUENCE_API_USER: "your.email@domain.com"
